# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by Cronholio.
#
# Each task to process has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be processd
# and what card to process for the task.
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# @daily and @hourly are also supported.
#
# Notice that reviews will be scheduled based on Anki's
# notion of time and timezones.
#
# For example, you can schedule a card for review
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 cid_1874826238
#
# For more information see the manual pages of Cronholio
# Note: All comment lines will be stripped upon saving,
#       a.k.a lazy programming.
